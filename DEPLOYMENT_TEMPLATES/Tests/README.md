## Using Deployment Configurations to deploy multiple instances and networks.
## Overview
Hi, my name is Momodu Afegbua - you probably know this already.
This is a collection of my Google Cloud Deployment Manager templates that I play with when I have nothing doing.
The general templates are in the 'multi-instance' folder and they include folders that create different networks, firewall rules,  and instance templates.
I am going to be using the comment button often in the templates to explain them and subsequently, I will be updating the repo. The templates are a collection of everything I have learnt online on Deployment manager.
Enjoy...
